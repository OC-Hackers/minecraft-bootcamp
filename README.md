# minecraft-bootcamp: Winter/Spring 2017-2018
> Learn Java through hands-on programming with Minecraft

Welcome to OC Hacker's Minecraft Bootcamp. Here, you can find educational resources for the development class including code, instructions, guides, and project compilations. By the end of this (originally) ten-week course, you will be able to build your own mods and plugins for server-gameplay and singleplayer gameplay in Minecraft. To supplement this course, you will also learn how to use MAVEN and GIT, as well as other real-world programming integrations and paradigms.

## Development

Dependency management and project compiling: MAVEN

## [Builds (Project Releases)](https://github.com/OC-Hackers/minecraft-bootcamp/releases)

This project is set to gitignore .jar files.

Please upload all binaries as a release instead. Make sure that they are fully tested and fully functional before uploading, otherwise if necessary, upload them as a "Beta" release (or untested release).
